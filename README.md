# Spreadsheet Pet Project

This repository is a pet project focused on understanding how to build a spreadsheet application similar to Excel or Google Sheets. The main goal of this project is to dive deep into how Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) work and how to handle tree structures on the client side.

## Project Goals

- Learn AST (Abstract Syntax Tree): Explore how ASTs are used to parse and interpret formulas, which is a core feature in spreadsheet applications.
- Client-Side Tree Manipulation: Gain experience in handling tree structures, commonly used in various aspects of programming, including parsers and expression evaluators.
- Spreadsheet Features: Implement basic spreadsheet functionalities such as cell references, formulas, and operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
- UI/UX: Develop a simple user interface to allow users to interact with the spreadsheet.

## Features

- Basic spreadsheet layout with editable cells.
- Formula parsing using an AST-based parser.
- Cell references and formula evaluation.
- Simple operations like SUM, AVERAGE, etc.

## Why This Project?

Spreadsheet applications like Excel and Google Sheets are a great case study for learning ASTs because they rely heavily on interpreting user input (formulas). Building a minimal version of a spreadsheet is a fun and challenging way to improve your understanding of client-side tree manipulation and parsing techniques.
